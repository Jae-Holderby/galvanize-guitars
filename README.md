# Galvanize Guitars

To complete this project, you'll need to:

- Create a wireframe
- Follow user stories
- Style using a CSS framework
- Add a color theme
- Include one or two font styles

## Narrative

You are making a website prototype for a local guitar store. They want you to start by designing 
the user home page. This page will display basic information about the company, the weekly 
guitar deal, and the user's list of favorite guitars. 

## User Stories

Your product owner has created a list of prioritized user stories for you to work down.

```
1. As a user, I need to see the name of the company
1. As a user, I need to be able to navigate to the store so I can browse for guitars
1. As a company, we need our contact information to be accessible so that our users can easily contact us 
1. As a user, I need to see the weekly guitar deal 
1. As a user, I need to see my list of favorited guitars 
1. As a user, I need a way to unfavorite a guitar from my list
1. As a company, we need to communicate that our material is copyrighted
1. As a company, we need a color theme and font style to create an aesthetically pleasing brand that our users can recognize 
```

## Wireframe

Before you code anything, read through the user stories. Design a wireframe that will improve
the *user experience* by implement effective visual hierarchy and design techniques like balance, 
movement, forgiveness, etc.

## APIs

The project requires you to use the mock data from the `guitars.json` file. The images are included
in the `assets` directory. Include them into your project and requests the data to populate the user's 
weekly guitar deal and favorites list. 

## Notes

- Commit and deploy your work after every user story
- Use a CSS Framework of your choice
- You can use jQuery or plain JavaScript for DOM manipulation and requests
- Your site does not need to have any functionality (navigation, persist data, etc.)
- Does not have to be responsive
- Practice feature-branch workflow
